- In the container the first component is **memory component** and the 2nd one is **code component**

- In **Memory component**, all the variables and functions are Stored in key value pairs. It is also called **Variable environment**.

- in **Code component**, code is executed one line at a time. It is also called **the Thread of Execution**.

- JS is a **synchronous**, **single-threaded** language
  - Synchronous:- In a specific synchronous order.
